# Responsive Web Design

In this crash course we will be discussing the very basics of Responsive Web Design (RWD), an approach to website design and development that focuses on making sites work on a wide variety of devices. The RWD process works by employing flexible layouts, flexible content, and media queries to make web pages respond to their environments, i.e., the monitors/screens they appear on.

Unfortunately, layout in CSS can be difficult for those who don't know the rules so most (even professional developers) aren't comfortable using CSS to layout a page. I'm going to assume that you also aren't comfortable using CSS for page layout, so you get a 2-for-1 deal with this meetup. We will start with a short bootcamp on doing page layout using floats in CSS. Then we'll discuss the three principles of Responsive Web Design and learn how to make layout flexible.

Who is this for? Anyone who wants to understand layout in CSS better and/or who want to learn something about Responsive Web Design.

What do I need to know? You should have at least a basic knowledge of HTML. Some exposure to basic CSS would be a plus.
